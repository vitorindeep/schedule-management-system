# Schedule Manager

Java application that manages the schedule of practical classes in a given major.

## Getting Started

Simply open the project located in the `netbeans-project` folder in netbeans.

## How it's built

The model package is the application itself.
The view package is the GUI.
The controller is a class that makes the connection between these two modules, and isolates them at the same time.
Changes to the view should never affect the code in the model, and vice versa. The controller is the one who has to conform to changes on both sides.
