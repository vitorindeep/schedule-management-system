 * Controller class - The only one that knows how view and model are implemented and depends on that implementation.
 *                    It connects those two modules together to form a beautiful work of bug-free art.
 *                    The controller should be minimal and simply connect the view and the model.
 *                    For user events, it subscribes to the view, pushes those changes to the model, and finishes up by updating the view back.
